== GraphML Report

This plugin generates graphml xml files for result data of concepts. Those files can be used with several graph rendering
and analytics tools like http://www.yworks.com/en/products/yfiles/yed/[yEd] and http://gephi.org[Gephi].

By default all concepts ending in `.graphml` will be rendered (e.g. "module:modules.graphml").
