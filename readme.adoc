This is the http://graphml.graphdrawing.org/[GraphML^] Plugin of https://www.jqassistant.org[jQAssistant^].
It enables jQAssistant to generate GraphML XML files for result data of concepts.
Those files can be used with several graph rendering
and analytics tools like http://www.yworks.com/en/products/yfiles/yed/[yEd^] and http://gephi.org[Gephi^].
